Simple implementation of k-nearest neighbours in python3.

Works for regression as well as classifcation.
Assumes categorical variables are preprocessed using methods such as one-hot encoding.
Also supports the use of a custom distance measure, as well as a custom prediction function for the k-nearest neighbours of a target point.
